# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

This project is a logo generator which generates a logo from the user input taken, users answer questions relating to the shape, color and text for the logo. This application makes the building of logos easier for wedsites, brands and people who need to make a simple logo. Throughout this project, I have learnt alot relating to the topics of classes, testing and inquirer. More specifically, when testing the code I learnt how to export multiple modules at once, which I didnt know before. 

## Usage

The link below leads to a video, showing how to use the logo generator and the code passing its tests:
